# Poetl-Solver
A python program that automatically solves the online NBA player guessing game "Poetl"

Using Pandas and Selenium, this program is able to automatically input guesses into "Poetl." Then, based upon the feedback received from the guess, this program scrapes the data from the webpage, and filters out an external database of NBA players. 

The program will then continue guessing till the game is solved, outputting the player and the number of guesses.




Output from a random guess:
